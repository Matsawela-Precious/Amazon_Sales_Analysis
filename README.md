# Amazon_Sales_Analysis

Objective
In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, effective sales management is essential for optimizing distribution channels, reducing costs, and maximizing profits. This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales and revenue trends to provide data-driven insights for informed decision-making. By leveraging data analysis, visualization, and developing a comprehensive dashboard, we aim to enhance Amazon's ability to identify key markets, improve product performance, and drive revenue growth.

Problem Statement
As Amazon continues to grow and competition intensifies, managing sales performance effectively is more critical than ever.
